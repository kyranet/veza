### Removed

### Fixed

-   Resolved bug from 0.6.0 where the queue was getting into data racing on extremely edge cases.

## 0.6.0

-   _Written more tests._
-   _Coverage 100%._
-   _Written **more** tests._
-   _And also added a shiny 100% coverage badge._

### Added

-   Added `socket.connecting`, `socket.connect`, `socket.destroy`, `socket.ready`, `socket.connect`, and `socket.ready`.

### Changed

-   `Node#connectTo` does not longer take an argument for the socket's `name`, also called "label". The name is now the socket's.

### Removed

-   `Infinity` is not longer an option in timeouts nor retry limits, refer to `-1` for the same behaviour.

-   Nullify the socket when destroyed.

### Fixed
