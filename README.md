## About

**Veza** is a protocol that operates over either [IPC] or [TCP] with the only difference of one line of code to switch
between the two. Inspired on [node-ipc], it seeks to use modern, fast, and intuitive [API]s, as well as exposing all the
underlying back-ends for much higher customizability and extensibility, as well as a HTTP-like protocol where you can
send a message and optionally receive a response for it.

## Socket Support

-   [x] Unix Socket or Windows Socket.
-   [x] TCP Socket.
-   [ ] TLS Socket.
-   [ ] UDP Sockets.

> **TLS**: TLS sockets can be achieved by extending Veza to use SSL handshakes. To keep things simple and tidy, this is
> not shipped in core, but will be considered for future releases.

> **UDP**: UDP sockets are not supported due to Veza's requirement for messages to be reliably received in order.

## Messaging

All messages are encoded and decoded using [`binarytf`][binarytf], which allows a messages to be sent using the least
amount of bytes possible, increasing throughput; plus a 11-byte header at the start of each message. More information
available in [PROTOCOL].
